# Contribution Guidelines

Explains for potential contributors:

- how to propose changes via issues and PRs
- expectations for clarity and documentation
- style guidelines for symbolic definitions
- commitment to not presenting symbolic tools as medical, financial, or guaranteed outcomes

## Overview

We welcome contributions to the AAL Ecosystem Specification repository. This is a **documentation-focused project** designed to establish conceptual authorship, provide architectural reference, and support future open-source development.

Contributions should align with AAL's core principles: **clarity, coherence, responsibility, and symbolic rigor**.

## Types of Contributions

### Documentation Improvements

- Clarifying existing documentation
- Fixing typos, formatting issues, or broken links
- Adding examples or use cases
- Expanding explanations of concepts

### New Symbolic Standards or Definitions

- Proposing new chaos sigils
- Extending Hyperstition Metrics or Ambiguity Index frameworks
- Adding new aesthetic forecast templates or examples

### Architectural Proposals

- Suggesting improvements to module interoperability
- Proposing new module concepts that fit the AAL philosophy
- Refining ResonanceFrame schema or communication protocols

### Code (Future)

- Once implementation repos are public, code contributions will follow standard open-source practices
- This repo currently contains **no code**, only documentation

## How to Contribute

### 1. Check Existing Issues and Discussions

Before proposing a change, check:

- **Issues**: See if the topic is already under discussion
- **Pull Requests**: See if someone is already working on it
- **Discussions** (if enabled): Engage with the community first for larger proposals

### 2. Open an Issue for Major Changes

For significant proposals (new modules, major symbolic standard additions, architectural changes):

1. Open an **Issue** with a clear title and description
2. Explain the **purpose** and **value** of the change
3. Provide **examples** or **mock-ups** where applicable
4. Wait for **feedback** from maintainers before proceeding

This prevents duplicated work and ensures alignment with AAL's direction.

### 3. Fork, Edit, and Submit a Pull Request

For smaller changes (typos, clarifications, minor additions):

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-typo-readme`, `add-sigil-definition-threshold`)
3. **Make your changes** following the guidelines below
4. **Commit** with clear, descriptive messages
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with a summary of changes and rationale

## Style and Quality Guidelines

### Documentation Style

- **Clear and Concise**: Avoid unnecessary jargon or verbosity
- **Structured**: Use headings, lists, and tables for readability
- **Examples**: Provide concrete examples where applicable
- **Markdown**: Follow GitHub-flavored Markdown conventions

### Symbolic Definitions

When proposing new chaos sigils, metrics, or standards:

1. **Name**: Clear, evocative, not redundant with existing definitions
2. **Definition**: What does it represent?
3. **Operational Meaning**: How does it affect system behavior or interpretation?
4. **Examples**: At least 2-3 concrete use cases
5. **Domain**: Which AAL modules would use it?
6. **Integration**: How does it fit with existing standards?

### Avoid

- **Speculation as Fact**: Don't claim behaviors or capabilities that don't exist
- **Medical/Financial Claims**: Don't frame symbolic tools as therapy, diagnosis, or investment advice
- **Overcomplexity**: Follow the **SEED principle**: added complexity must reduce entropy somewhere
- **Inconsistency**: Ensure new content aligns with existing architecture and terminology

## Review Process

1. **Maintainer Review**: All PRs are reviewed by repository maintainers
2. **Feedback**: You may be asked to revise or clarify
3. **Approval**: Once approved, your PR will be merged
4. **Attribution**: Contributors are acknowledged in commit history and (where appropriate) in documentation

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the **MIT License** that governs this repository.

You retain copyright to your contributions, but grant AAL and the community permission to use, modify, and distribute them under the MIT License terms.

## Symbolic Work as Valid Research

AAL treats **symbolic work** (semiotics, narrative architecture, emotional modeling, cultural analysis) as **valid research and intellectual contribution**.

Contributions in these domains are valued equally with technical or quantitative work, provided they:

- Are **rigorous**: Well-defined, coherent, and thoughtfully constructed
- Are **documented**: Clearly explained with examples and rationale
- **Avoid overclaiming**: Don't present symbolic interpretations as objective truth or guaranteed outcomes

## Code of Conduct (Implicit)

While we don't have a formal Code of Conduct document yet, contributors are expected to:

- Be **respectful** and **professional**
- **Assume good intent** from others
- Provide **constructive feedback**, not personal attacks
- **Acknowledge others' work** and credit where due
- Engage in **good faith** with the AAL philosophy and community

Harassment, trolling, or malicious behavior will not be tolerated.

## Contact for Questions

If you're unsure about a contribution or have questions:

**Daniel K. Meyer**
Email: `dkmeyer1@student.fullsail.com`

Or open an **Issue** labeled "Question" for community discussion.

## What We're Looking For

We especially welcome contributions that:

- **Clarify ambiguity** in existing documentation
- **Provide real-world use cases** for symbolic standards
- **Expand examples** in aesthetic forecasting, dream interpretation, or other applied domains
- **Identify gaps** in the current specification
- **Improve accessibility** of technical or symbolic content

## What We're Not Looking For

- Proprietary code or confidential information (this is a public documentation repo)
- Unstructured "stream of consciousness" content without clear purpose
- Content that violates ethical boundaries (medical claims, harmful hyperstitions, etc.)
- Duplicate or redundant definitions without clear justification

## Future: Open-Source Module Implementations

Once AAL modules move toward public release, separate repositories will be created for:

- **AAL-Core** implementation
- **Abraxas Kernel** public components
- **BeatOven** public API and tools
- **Noctis Engine** integration libraries
- Etc.

Those repos will have their own contribution guidelines tailored to code contributions, testing, and development workflows.

This repo remains the **conceptual and architectural hub** for the ecosystem.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AAL. By participating, you're helping build a **public, coherent, and rigorous** foundation for symbolic-technical systems that bridge meaning, creativity, and intelligence.

Every contribution—whether a typo fix or a major symbolic framework—helps strengthen the ecosystem and its community.
