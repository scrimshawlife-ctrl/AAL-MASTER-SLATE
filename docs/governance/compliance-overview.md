# Compliance Overview

## Overview

This document provides a high-level, non-legal summary of how Applied Alchemy Labs (AAL) approaches compliance, safety, and responsible use of its systems. This is **not legal or medical advice**, and does not constitute a comprehensive compliance program. Users and contributors should consult qualified professionals for domain-specific guidance.

## Purpose

AAL aims to:

- Operate transparently and responsibly
- Avoid overclaiming capabilities or outcomes
- Respect user privacy and data boundaries
- Maintain clear distinctions between conceptual work and regulated domains
- Foster a culture of safety and ethical awareness

## Key Principles

### 1. Transparency

**Commitment**: Be clear about what AAL systems do, how they work, and what their limitations are.

**Practices**:
- Public documentation of system architecture and symbolic standards
- Clear disclaimers on forecasts, recommendations, and outputs
- Open acknowledgment of uncertainty and ambiguity
- No hidden agendas or undisclosed data usage

### 2. No Overclaiming

**Commitment**: Avoid claiming medical, financial, legal, or guaranteed outcomes.

**Practices**:
- Forecasts are presented as **probabilistic and exploratory**, not deterministic
- Symbolic interpretations are framed as **tools for meaning-making**, not objective truth
- D-LAPS products are described with appropriate disclaimers and safety information
- Users are encouraged to consult professionals for regulated decisions

### 3. Responsible Data Usage

**Commitment**: Handle user data with care, transparency, and respect for privacy.

**Practices**:
- Minimize data collection to what's necessary for functionality
- Provide users with control over their data
- Avoid sharing or selling user data without explicit consent
- Use anonymization and aggregation where appropriate

### 4. Clear Internal and External Boundaries

**Commitment**: Maintain distinctions between:

- **Public documentation** (this repository) and **internal proprietary work**
- **Conceptual research** and **compliant real-world products**
- **Symbolic exploration** and **regulated professional advice**

**Practices**:
- Public repo contains documentation, not proprietary code or research
- D-LAPS maintains separate "conceptual lab" and "compliance lab" architectures
- Symbolic work is clearly labeled as such, not conflated with medical/psychological treatment

### 5. Safety and Harm Reduction

**Commitment**: Avoid amplifying harmful narratives, hyperstitions, or destabilizing patterns.

**Practices**:
- Abraxas and Noctis are designed to surface patterns, not to manipulate or coerce
- High-Hyperstition Score narratives are flagged with appropriate context
- Users are provided with tools for conscious engagement, not passive consumption
- Systems prioritize user agency over algorithmic determinism

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### Forecasting and Prediction (Abraxas, HollerSports)

**Key Risks**:
- Users may treat probabilistic forecasts as guaranteed outcomes
- Sports betting carries financial and addiction risks
- Political/market forecasts may influence behavior in unintended ways

**Mitigations**:
- Clear labeling of confidence levels and ambiguity
- Disclaimers that forecasts are **not financial or betting advice**
- Encouragement to use forecasts as **one input among many**, not sole decision driver
- No direct integration with betting platforms (users must act independently)

### Symbolic Interpretation and Introspection (Noctis, PsyFi, Emberline)

**Key Risks**:
- Users may treat symbolic interpretations as psychological diagnosis or therapy
- Vulnerable users may become overly dependent on system outputs
- Dream and emotional work can surface difficult or traumatic material

**Mitigations**:
- Clear disclaimers that systems are **not therapy** and **not a replacement for professional mental health care**
- Encouragement to seek licensed professionals for clinical concerns
- Design emphasizes **user agency**: systems provide tools, not prescriptions
- Sensitive outputs are framed neutrally and non-coercively

### Supplements and Products (D-LAPS)

**Key Risks**:
- Dietary supplements are not FDA-approved drugs
- Users may have unrealistic expectations or adverse reactions
- Marketing must avoid making disease claims or medical promises

**Mitigations**:
- D-LAPS maintains a **dual-lab architecture**: conceptual research is separate from compliant product formulation
- Public-facing products include appropriate disclaimers and safety information
- No claims of curing, treating, or diagnosing medical conditions
- Users are encouraged to consult healthcare professionals before use
- Transparent ingredient lists and dosage information

### Creative Tools (BeatOven, Phonomicon, PatchHive)

**Key Risks**:
- Copyright and intellectual property concerns
- Potential misuse for harmful or deceptive content
- User expectations around quality and originality

**Mitigations**:
- Users retain ownership of their creative outputs
- Systems are designed for **augmentation**, not replacement of human creativity
- No scraping of copyrighted material without permission
- Outputs include provenance metadata to support attribution

## Prohibited Uses

AAL systems should **not** be used for:

- **Medical diagnosis or treatment** (use licensed healthcare providers)
- **Legal advice or representation** (use licensed attorneys)
- **Financial guarantees or investment promises** (use licensed financial advisors)
- **Manipulation, coercion, or deception** (respect user autonomy)
- **Harm, harassment, or exploitation** (maintain ethical boundaries)

Users who attempt to misuse AAL systems in these ways are not supported and may be restricted from access.

## User Responsibilities

Users of AAL systems are responsible for:

- **Reading and understanding disclaimers** provided with system outputs
- **Consulting qualified professionals** for medical, legal, financial, and other regulated decisions
- **Using systems ethically** and respecting the rights and dignity of others
- **Providing feedback** when systems produce harmful, confusing, or inappropriate outputs

## Contributor Responsibilities

Contributors to AAL (code, documentation, research) are expected to:

- **Adhere to SEED and ABX-Core principles** in design and implementation
- **Avoid introducing harm vectors** or exploitable vulnerabilities
- **Document systems clearly** so users can understand what's happening
- **Respect intellectual property** and licensing agreements
- **Maintain professional and respectful communication**

## Incident Response

If a compliance concern, safety issue, or ethical problem arises:

1. **Report**: Contact maintainers via listed channels (email, GitHub issues)
2. **Assessment**: Maintainers will assess the issue and its severity
3. **Mitigation**: Appropriate actions will be taken (documentation updates, system changes, user notifications)
4. **Transparency**: Where appropriate, incidents and resolutions will be documented publicly

## Evolution of This Framework

This compliance overview will evolve as:

- AAL systems mature and expand
- Regulatory landscapes shift
- Community feedback highlights blind spots or gaps
- New risks and considerations emerge

Version updates will be tracked in the repository changelog.

## Conclusion

AAL's approach to compliance is rooted in **transparency, responsibility, and user agency**. By clearly articulating what systems do (and don't do), maintaining appropriate boundaries, and fostering a culture of ethical awareness, AAL aims to operate as a responsible and trustworthy ecosystem.

Compliance is not a checkbox—it's an ongoing practice. As the ecosystem evolves, so too will these frameworks, always guided by the principles of clarity, safety, and respect.
