# Noctis Engine

## Overview
Noctis Engine is a dream interpretation and tracking module.

## Purpose
- Parse dream reports into symbolic structures.
- Generate suggestions for sigils, meditations, and rituals.
- Maintain a dream grimoire across time.

## Architecture
- Dream ingestion and parsing layer
- Symbolic/archetypal mapping
- Integration with Abraxas for cross-day symbolic threads
- Output for rituals, sigils, and practices

## IO Model
- Inputs: user dream narratives and optional context.
- Outputs: symbolic interpretations, tags, and mediated suggestions.

## Relationship to AAL-Core
Noctis Engine publishes dream-derived frames and can also consume Abraxas frames for context.

## Example Output (Text)
- "Recurring 'labyrinth + watcher' motif suggests threshold phase with surveillance anxiety and hidden-path potential."
