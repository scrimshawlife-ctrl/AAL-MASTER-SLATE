# ABX-Runes Overview

ABX-Runes is the symbolic compute layer of AAL.

## Purpose

- Provide a compact way to represent symbolic operations.
- Allow "runic" programs: sequences of symbols with operational meaning.
- Enable cross-domain symbolic reuse (dreams, markets, sports, art, etc.).

## Deployment Layers

1. **In-Process JIT** – fast interpretive layer inside modules.
2. **System-Wide Shim** – intercepts and enhances symbolic operations between processes.
3. **DBI Agent** – dynamic binary instrumentation for profiling and adaptive adjustment (conceptual future).

## Capabilities

- encode emotional vectors
- express ritual timing and state changes
- link symbolic events to numerical metrics
- annotate and transform ResonanceFrames
