# Abraxas Kernel Architecture

The Abraxas Kernel is the primary symbolic intelligence layer in AAL.

## Goals

- Model coherence and drift in symbolic systems (stories, markets, cultures).
- Generate oracles, forecasts, and aesthetic guidance.
- Serve as an experimental alignment layer—framing alignment as coherence rather than mere constraint.

## Layers

1. **Input Layer** – Collects raw text, events, metrics, and symbolic signals.
2. **Resonance Engine** – Identifies tensions, patterns, and echo structures in the data.
3. **Meme-Weather Engine** – Maps trends and memetic flows.
4. **Forecast Layer** – Produces scenario sketches, probabilities, and symbolic guidance.
5. **Output Formatter** – Renders results as oracles, reports, or aesthetic forecasts.

## Integration

The kernel communicates with:

- **HollerSports** for symbolic overlays on sports data
- **BeatOven** for emotional/sonic mappings
- **Noctis Engine** for dream-sourced symbolic streams
- **Phonomicon** for symbolic guidance in visual minting
