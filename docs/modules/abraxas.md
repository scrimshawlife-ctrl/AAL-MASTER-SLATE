# Abraxas Engine

## Overview
Abraxas is the symbolic intelligence engine of AAL, focused on coherence, forecast, and memetic topology.

## Purpose
- Analyze symbolic patterns in data, stories, and events.
- Produce oracles, forecasts, and interpretive overlays.
- Act as a "meaning layer" for other modules.

## Architecture
- Input collector
- Resonance and tension mapper
- Meme-weather analyzer
- Forecast generator
- Formatter for multiple output formats (oracles, reports, overlays)

## IO Model
- Inputs: ResonanceFrames with text, metrics, tags.
- Outputs: ResonanceFrames with added forecasts, probabilities, and symbolic tags.

## Relationship to AAL-Core
Abraxas is a first-class module connected through the AAL Hub and ResonanceFrame schema.

## Example Output (Text)
- Daily oracle summaries
- Memetic weather reports
- Symbolic aesthetic forecasts
