# Abraxas Engine

## Overview
Abraxas is the symbolic intelligence engine of AAL, focused on coherence, forecast, and memetic topology.

## Purpose
- Analyze symbolic patterns in data, stories, and events.
- Produce oracles, forecasts, and interpretive overlays.
- Act as a "meaning layer" for other modules.

## Architecture
- Input collector
- Resonance and tension mapper
- Meme-weather analyzer
- Forecast generator
- Formatter for multiple output formats (oracles, reports, overlays)
- Event-correlation analysis subsystem (offline + reportable)
- Artifacts pipeline with dashboard + diffing lens
- Acceptance suite for deterministic validation
- Overlay request/response layer for cross-module outputs

## IO Model
- Inputs: ResonanceFrames with text, metrics, tags.
- Outputs: ResonanceFrames with added forecasts, probabilities, and symbolic tags.

## Relationship to AAL-Core
Abraxas is a first-class module connected through the AAL Hub and ResonanceFrame schema.

## Expanded Subsystems (Post-2026-01 Ingest)
- **Event Correlation Analysis**: correlates symbolic and metric events, with offline correlation runs feeding forecast confidence.
- **Artifacts System**: curated artifacts pipeline, diffing views, and dashboard lens for historical comparison.
- **Acceptance Suite**: deterministic acceptance runs for oracle outputs and report surfaces.
- **Overlay Refactor**: request/response objects for overlay generation, enabling consistent downstream rendering.

## Example Output (Text)
- Daily oracle summaries
- Memetic weather reports
- Symbolic aesthetic forecasts
