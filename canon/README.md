# 📜 AAL Canon – Binding Standards

This directory contains **versioned canonical documents** that establish binding laws and constraints for AAL systems.

## Purpose

Canon documents are **not advisory**—they are **binding specifications** that:

- Define required behaviors and constraints
- Establish forbidden operations
- Set architectural boundaries
- Govern generative, musical, and symbolic systems
- Ensure coherence across the AAL ecosystem

## Canonical Standards

### Core Doctrine

- **[AAL Modular Design Doctrine v1.0](modular-design-doctrine-v1.0.md)** ✅ Published
  - Governs BeatOven, PatchHive, Abraxas overlays, and all generative instruments
  - Establishes ritual lifecycle enforcement (PREP → THRESHOLD → PEAK → RELEASE → SEAL)
  - Defines space as first-class modulatable process
  - Enforces bounded chaos and bounded infinity
  - Requires mandatory sealing and termination semantics

### Standards (Planned)

- **Constraint Graph Standard** 📝 In Development
  - Formal specification for forbidden interaction graphs
  - Edge types, node types, and enforcement mechanisms

- **Containment Budget Standard** 📝 In Development
  - Complexity budget allocation and tracking
  - Graceful degradation protocols

- **Ritual Lifecycle Standard** 📝 In Development
  - Detailed phase definitions and transitions
  - State machine formalization

- **Space Operator Standard** 📝 In Development
  - Reverb, delay, diffusion as first-class modulatable processes
  - Memory-bearing spatial semantics

- **Pareto Tradeoff Documentation Guidelines** 📝 In Development
  - Required documentation format for design tradeoffs
  - Multi-objective optimization transparency

## Versioning

All canon documents use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR):

- **MAJOR** version changes indicate breaking changes to binding constraints
- **MINOR** version changes add new constraints or clarifications without breaking existing compliance

## Compliance

All AAL modules and contributions must comply with applicable canon documents. Non-compliance is grounds for rejection or deprecation.

## Evolution

Canon documents evolve through:

1. Proposal and review
2. Community feedback
3. Maintainer approval
4. Version increment and publication
5. Migration period (if breaking)
