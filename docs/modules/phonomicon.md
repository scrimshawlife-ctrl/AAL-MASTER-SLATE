# Phonomicon

## Overview
Phonomicon converts sound into visual, symbolically enriched artifacts (including NFTs).

## Purpose
- Turn audio recordings into visual works guided by emotional and symbolic vectors.
- Attach provenance via hashing and on-chain records.
- Provide a Proof-of-Resonance framework for creative work.

## Architecture
- Audio feature extraction
- Emotional and symbolic mapping
- Visual synthesis pipeline (GPU-enabled)
- Provenance and manifest hashing

## IO Model
- Inputs: audio, symbolic intent, and metadata.
- Outputs: image specs, metadata, and optional NFT manifests.

## Relationship to AAL-Core
Phonomicon consumes and produces ResonanceFrames linked to audio and visual artifacts.

## Example Output (Text)
- "Mint a visual artifact keyed to 'ascent through wreckage' from this audio sample, with a high Hyperstition Score and low Ambiguity Index."
