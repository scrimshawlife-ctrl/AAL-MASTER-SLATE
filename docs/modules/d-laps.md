# D-LAPS

## Overview
D-LAPS is a supplement and protocol ecosystem centered on dopamine repair and sustainable performance.

## Purpose
- Provide structured stacks targeting focus, recovery, cognition, and metabolism.
- Integrate with symbolic and behavioral systems via AAL modules.
- Serve as a bridge between conceptual models and compliant real-world products.

## Architecture
- Conceptual lab: models and hypotheses.
- Compliance lab: real-world constrained implementation.
- Translation layer: converts conceptual language into compliant, public-safe framing.
- Integration layer: interfaces with Emberline, Noctis, and Abraxas.

## IO Model
- Inputs: conceptual research data, user feedback, external studies.
- Outputs: supplement protocols, guidelines, and symbolic framing (in doc form, not medical advice).

## Relationship to AAL-Core
D-LAPS metadata and narrative structures can be tracked via ResonanceFrames, but the biochemical work remains external.

## Example Output (Text)
- "D-LAPS Prime is framed as a recovery-grade support stack for dopamine and resilience; always to be contextualized with rest, nutrition, and medical advice from professionals."
